[VaaS][1] integration based on a hook mechanic.
An app is usually registered with VaaS once it becomes healthy and deregistered before termination.
Taskâ€™s desired address (`-aaddress`) and port (`--port`) will be registered under director 
provided by `--director`.
If task has defined weight it can be provided with `--weight`
If task is a canary instance (has `--canary` switch) backend is tagged
as a canary.
